VisualStruct AI â€“ Extract Structured Rules and Patterns from Visual Documents
ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement:
Documents like SOPs, batch sheets, and process forms (e.g., in pharma, manufacturing, legal) contain complex visual structures â€” tables with colored boxes, checkboxes with values, and special layouts. Traditional OCR often misses context, structure, or semantic meaning (e.g., colored checkboxes, embedded decimal boxes, etc.).

ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
Build a Python-based AI system that can:

Extract text, tables, and visual boxes with color and numeric values

Detect colored backgrounds (e.g., yellow/blue cells) and associate them with semantic meaning

Store rules/patterns (e.g., yellow boxes = quantity input) for reuse

Generate structured JSON output from unstructured, image-based documents.
